                <p>undf-kc-1912.2-GER</p>

                <h3 class="red">Discovered by / at:</h3>
                <p>Wassily Kandinsky, in his studio in Munich, at Feb 1912</p>

                <h3 class="green">Family:</h3>
                <p>As Kandinsky wrote in his diary, 'This little lonely spirit... I'm not even sure if it only exists as an illusion of myself.' Since there has been no other records showing traces of similar painting-related spirits, I would say no family or species found so far.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>Kandinskyâ€™s first canvases used for avant-garde creations</p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>A round-shape body constantly flashing in color and size, normally having four orbiting geometric shapes, will transform into a set of rectangles after you start painting.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Tend to follow the movement of the brush.</li>
                    <li>Restrained within the canvas.</li>
                    <li>Transforms shape when you start painting.</li>
                    <li>Transforms the painting!</li>

                <span class="yellow">What we know so far about Kandinsky's Chromaphone?</span>
                It was first found as a fictional form, in Kangdinsky's diary entry, when he was experimenting with colors and shapes. It was later discovered by a group of art historians in 2025, when they were trying to recreate Kandinsky's painting process. The creature was found to be a living form that can interact with the brush and the painting. The creature is believed to be a spirit of Kandinsky's painting.
                <br>
                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> Take your brush, and play with it! First of all it follows the brush in a way that's similar to Coulomb's Law. Once the brush touchs the canvas, it transforms into a bunch of evolving rectangles. After that, prepare to see the illusions of Kangdinsky.
